Overlapping Marker Spiderfier for Leaflet
=========================================

**Ever noticed how, in [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com), marker
pins that overlap each other spring apart gracefully when you click
them, so you can pick the one you meant?**

**And ever noticed how, when using the [Leaflet
API](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com), the same thing doesn't happen?**

This code makes Leaflet map markers behave in that Google Earth way
(minus the animation). Small numbers of markers (yes, up to 8) spiderfy
into a circle. Larger numbers fan out into a more space-efficient
spiral.

The compiled code has no dependencies beyond Leaflet. And it's under 3K
when compiled out of
[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), minified
with Google's [Closure
Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) and gzipped.

It's a port of my [original library for the Google Maps
API](https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier). (Since the
Leaflet API doesn't let us observe all the event types that the Google
one does, the main difference between the original and the port is this:
you must first call `unspiderfy` if and when you want to move a marker
in the Leaflet version).

### Doesn't clustering solve this problem?

You may have seen the marker clustering libraries, which also help deal
with markers that are close together.

That might be what you want. However, it probably **isn't** what you
want (or isn't the only thing you want) if you have markers that could
be in the exact same location, or close enough to overlap even at the
maximum zoom level. In that case, clustering won't help your users see
and/or click on the marker they're looking for.

Demo
----

See the [demo
map](http://jawj.github.com/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier-Leaflet/demo.html)
(the data is random: reload the map to reposition the markers).

Download
--------

Download [the compiled, minified JS
source](https://unpkg.com/overlapping-marker-spiderfier-leaflet@latest).

Or download it from npm:
`npm isntall -S overlapping-marker-spiderfier-leaflet` or
`yarn add overlapping-marker-spiderfier-leaflet`

How to use
----------

See the [demo map
source](http://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier-Leaflet/blob/gh-pages/demo.html),
or follow along here for a slightly simpler usage with commentary.

Create your map like normal (using the beautiful [Stamen watercolour OSM
map](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor)):

```javascript
var map = new L.Map('map_canvas', {center: new L.LatLng(51.505, -0.09), zoom: 13});
var layer = new L.StamenTileLayer('watercolor');
map.addLayer(layer);
```

Create an `OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier` instance:

```javascript
var oms = new OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier(map);
```  

Instead of adding click listeners to your markers directly via
`marker.addEventListener` or `marker.on`, add a global listener on the
`OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier` instance instead. The listener will be
passed the clicked marker as its first argument.

```javascript
var popup = new L.Popup();
oms.addListener('click', function(marker) {
  popup.setContent(marker.desc);
  popup.setLatLng(marker.getLatLng());
  map.openPopup(popup);
});
```

You can also add listeners on the `spiderfy` and `unspiderfy` events,
which will be passed an array of the markers affected. In this example,
we observe only the `spiderfy` event, using it to close any open
`InfoWindow`:

```javascript
oms.addListener('spiderfy', function(markers) {
  map.closePopup();
});
```

Finally, tell the `OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier` instance about each
marker as you add it, using the `addMarker` method:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < window.mapData.length; i ++) {
  var datum = window.mapData[i];
  var loc = new L.LatLng(datum.lat, datum.lon);
  var marker = new L.Marker(loc);
  marker.desc = datum.d;
  map.addLayer(marker);
  oms.addMarker(marker);  // <-- here
}
```

Docs

### Loading

The Leaflet `L` object must be available when this code runs --- i.e.
put the Leaflet API \<script&gt; tag before this one. The code has been
tested with the 0.4 API version.

### Construction

```javascript
new OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier(map, options)
```

Creates an instance associated with `map` (an `L.Map`).

The `options` argument is an optional `Object` specifying any options
you want changed from their defaults. The available options are:

**keepSpiderfied** (default: `false`)

By default, the OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier works like Google Earth, in
that when you click a spiderfied marker, the markers unspiderfy before
any other action takes place.

Since this can make it tricky for the user to work through a set of
markers one by one, you can override this behaviour by setting the
`keepSpiderfied` option to `true`.

**nearbyDistance** (default: `20`).

This is the pixel radius within which a marker is considered to be
overlapping a clicked marker.

**circleSpiralSwitchover** (default: `9`)

This is the lowest number of markers that will be fanned out into a
spiral instead of a circle. Set this to `0` to always get spirals, or
`Infinity` for all circles.

**legWeight** (default: `1.5`)

This determines the thickness of the lines joining spiderfied markers to
their original locations.

### Instance methods: managing markers

Note: methods that have no obvious return value return the
OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier instance they were called on, in case you
want to chain method calls.

```javascript
addMarker(marker)
```

Adds `marker` (an `L.Marker`) to be tracked.

```javascript
removeMarker(marker)
```

Removes `marker` from those being tracked.

```javascript
clearMarkers()
```

Removes every `marker` from being tracked. Much quicker than calling
`removeMarker` in a loop, since that has to search the markers array
every time.

```javascript
getMarkers()
```

Returns an `Array` of all the markers that are currently being tracked.
This is a copy of the one used internally, so you can do what you like
with it.

### Instance methods: managing listeners

```javascript
addListener(event, listenerFunc)
```

Adds a listener to react to one of three events.

`event` may be `'click'`, `'spiderfy'` or `'unspiderfy'`.

For `'click'` events, `listenerFunc` receives one argument: the clicked
marker object. You'll probably want to use this listener to do something
like show an `L.Popup`.

For `'spiderfy'` or `'unspiderfy'` events, `listenerFunc` receives two
arguments: first, an `Array` of the markers that were spiderfied or
unspiderfied; second, an `Array` of the markers that were not. One use
for these listeners is to make some distinction between spiderfied and
non-spiderfied markers when some markers are spiderfied --- e.g.
highlighting those that are spiderfied, or dimming out those that
aren't.

```javascript
removeListener(event, listenerFunc)
```

Removes the specified listener on the specified event.

```javascript
clearListeners(event)
```

Removes all listeners on the specified event.

```javascript
unspiderfy()
```

Returns any spiderfied markers to their original positions, and triggers
any listeners you may have set for this event. Unless no markers are
spiderfied, in which case it does nothing. Be sure to call this before
you call `setLatLng` on any tracked marker.

### Properties

You can set the following properties on an OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier
instance:

**legColors.usual** and **legColors.highlighted**

These determine the usual and highlighted colours of the lines.

You can also get and set any of the options noted in the constructor
function documentation above as properties on an
OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier instance.
